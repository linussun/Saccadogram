The \"Eye Other\" signal in ML2 is either sometimes blank or set to the opposite eye signal (which is always covered with a patch in monocular recordings thus not relevant). In these cases, when only 1 eye is recorded, we can ignore 'other eye' recording and set the monocular .Signal to the \"Eye\" signal in the bhv2 file. \n",
