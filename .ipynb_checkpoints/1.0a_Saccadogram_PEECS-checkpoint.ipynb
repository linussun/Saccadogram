    "For Monocular recordings:\n",

    "We have been changing the ML2 control panel settings for \"Eye\" to either right eye or left eye signal from the Eyelink eye tracker. The \"Eye Other\" signal in ML2 is either sometimes blank or set to the opposite eye signal (which is always covered with a patch in monocular recordings thus not relevant). In these cases, when only 1 eye is recorded, we can ignore 'other eye' recording and set the monocular .Signal to the \"Eye\" signal in the bhv2 file. \n",
    "\n",
    "For binocular recordings (moving forward) ML2 should follow the left or right eye. Signals are stored in Trials(n).SignalsOD or SignalsOS and saved in Signals(n,1:3), where n = 1 for OD and n=2 for OS signals.\n",
